  In order to customize my Ibexa installation
  I want to manage my content types.

  Scenario: Changes can be discarded while creating content type
    Given I'm on content type Page for "Content" group
    When I create a new content type
      And I set fields
      | label      | value                     |
      | Name       | Test content type         |
      | Identifier | TestContentTypeIdentifier |
      And I perform the "Discard" action
    Then I should be on content type group page for "Content" group
      And there's no "Test content type" on content types list
